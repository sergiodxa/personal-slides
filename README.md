# Personal Slides

This are the slides used on my talks, either in courses, workshops, etc.

## How to run

### Development

All that's needed to run this blog is:

```bash
yarn
yarn dev
```

Then head to http://localhost:3000. Changes you make to components will henceforth be reflected there in realtime.

### Deployment

All that's needed to deploy this site to the cloud is to execute a single command

```
now
```

This will build and export to HTML files the site, generate the RSS feed, deploy it to [Now](https://now.sh) and then alias it automatically.
